# What is this?

This is a personal content site for writing down some notes. I'm not a native English speaker, so please don't waste your time saying "He misspelled this".

The content you are going to find on the site might be some commands or ways of doing things that I'll write down for later consulting. If this is a solution to one of your problems, then good for you.

I hope you can find some of these notes useful, or get inspired to do something similar in your free time.

## Main topics

I'll cover here some of the topics I use for work or my personal life. This list will probably grow over time, or stay the same, who knows?
